* Pause inputs when clearing lines (should be easy in `clearLines`)
  => will be able to remove `&& !this.state.fullLinesIndices.length`
* Reset timer when throwing new piece! (sometimes the new piece immediatly moves)
  => related to previous bullet
* Reset timer when moving down manually (easiest to place piece)
* Dissociate movedown timing, and merge timing!
  => Give time to move piece before merging
* Highlight last piece during merging (temporary keep positions and piece)
  => useful when moving down manually and also when triggering merge with space
* Don't prevent to rotate on left/right part of game (push left/right to create space to rotate)
